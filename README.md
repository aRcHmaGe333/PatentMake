# IPClaim

**Intellectual Property Claim for An Era of Progress**

IPClaim is a repo toolkit and proof model for publishing authorship claims as public, timestamped, independently verifiable records. `Stamped` is the service/bundling layer built on the same model, not a separate proof system.

## IPClaim: Meta-Proof - Your work is its own witness

IPClaim replaces traditional paperwork and gatekeeping with cryptographic certainty. 
Your work is its own ID, stands as its own testament — timestamped, verifiable, and enduring.
- Proof embedded in your code, blueprint, disclosure
- Authorship verifiable by anyone, anywhere
- Ownership based on evidence

One system is based on evidence. The other is based on permission.

## You Claim What You Made 
when you
## Show it to the World

You don't need to know which parts of your work are protectable and which aren't. You don't need to hire a lawyer to figure out the boundaries. You don't need to search databases to check if someone else did something similar. You don't need to classify your work into legal categories.

You publish. You timestamp. You claim everything you created.

If something you made can be protected as a patent — you claimed it. If it falls under copyright — you claimed it. If it falls under some category that doesn't exist yet — you claimed it the moment you published, and the timestamp proves when.

If someone else disclosed their unique IP before you, your claim does not include that part. It only covers the Intellectual Property you created and disclosed, timestamped. Your verifiable unique work is undeniably exposed to the public — no one else can claim it as theirs, for any purpose, in any context.

**What this removes from your life:**

- **No prior art search.** You don't need to pay someone to find out if your work is "novel enough."
- **No legal classification.** You don't decide what type of protection applies. The work speaks for itself.
- **No filing fees.** No renewal fees. No maintenance schedule. No expiration.
- **No gatekeepers.** No examiner approves or rejects your claim. The math proves it.
- **No waiting.** A patent takes 2-5 years. This takes seconds.

**What you keep:**

- Full ownership of everything you created.
- Permanent proof that you created it first.
- A record that anyone can verify — courts, investors, competitors, collaborators — using free tools, in under a minute.

The traditional system asks you to be an inventor, a lawyer, a business analyst, and a clerk — all at once, all on your own dime, all before you're allowed to say "this is mine." IPClaim asks you to do one thing: publish your work.

## Stamp a Repo (Automated)

The fastest way to claim a repository. From anywhere:

```bash
/path/to/IPClaim/stamp.sh /path/to/your-repo "Your Name" [apc|apc-vf]
```

Or run it with prompts:

```bash
/path/to/IPClaim/stamp.sh /path/to/your-repo
```

This single command:

1. Copies the timestamp workflow, verification instructions, and your chosen license into the target repo
2. Fills in your author name, tree hash, and date automatically
3. Commits and (optionally) pushes — triggering the timestamp workflow on GitHub

Prerequisites: the target must be a git repo with at least one commit and a GitHub remote. If you can `git push`, the rest works.

## Manual Setup (Fallback)

If `stamp.sh` doesn't work for your setup, you can perform the same steps by hand.

### 1. Add a License

Select from two license options:

- `LICENSE-APC.md` — All rights reserved, with authorship and IP claim
- `LICENSE-APC-VF.md` — Same, with ValueFlow profit sharing included

Copy your chosen license into your repository and fill in the placeholders: author name, tree hash (`git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}`), and today's date.

### 2. Enable Timestamping

Copy `.github/workflows/timestamp.yml` into your repository. Each push to main or master will:

- Compute your repo's tree hash (Git's content hash for the tracked repository tree)
- Timestamp it via FreeTSA.org (RFC 3161)
- Save the `.tsr` proof in `.timestamps/`
- Commit and push the evidence

### 3. Add Verification Instructions

Copy `VERIFY.md` into your repository. It contains step-by-step instructions for anyone to independently verify your claim using OpenSSL — no accounts, no fees, no intermediaries.

## How It Works

The process is straightforward and open:

1. **Commit your work** — push your creation to GitHub.
2. **Fingerprint it** — Git generates a unique hash of your project.
3. **Seal it in time** — the hash is timestamped via FreeTSA.org.
4. **Preserve the proof** — the `.tsr` token is stored in `.timestamps/` and committed.
5. **Verify anytime** — confirm the timestamp and integrity with free tools.

Everything happens within your repository. No external service holds your proof.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `stamp.sh` | Automate the full IPClaim setup on any repo |
| `LICENSE-APC.md` | All-rights-reserved license template |
| `LICENSE-APC-VF.md` | License with ValueFlow profit sharing |
| `VERIFY.md` | Independent verification instructions |
| `.github/workflows/timestamp.yml` | Drop-in workflow for automatic timestamping |
| `STAMPED-whitepaper.md` | The full case for why this works |

`LICENSE-APC.md` and `LICENSE-APC-VF.md` are separate license tracks. `APC-VF` extends the base model with ValueFlow terms and is versioned independently.

## Why It Matters

IPClaim empowers creators by prioritizing evidence over authority. It establishes a public, unalterable record. Each commit is a declaration of authorship, supported by cryptography and time. For creators, this means gaining the recognition and protection they deserve — without asking permission from anyone.
